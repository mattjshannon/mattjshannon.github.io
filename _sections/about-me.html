<p>I am an astrophysicist working at NASA Ames in Mountain View, California. My expertise is in data analysis, Python programming, scientific research, writing, and collaboration. In my work, I utilize machine learning and statistical methods to study the nature of organic molecules in space; my interests are particularly pointed towards the analysis of large-scale astronomical datasets and the ability to find compact representations, and the implications therein.</p>

<p>Beyond my scientific research focus, I am a co-developer of the <a href="https://www.astrochemistry.org/pahdb/">NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database</a> (PAHdb). I also enjoy working on the development of new research-enabling tools, such as <a href="https://github.com/PAHdb/pyPAHdb">pyPAHdb</a>, a streamlined Python version of the Ames database, which I presented at the SciPy 2018 conference in Austin, TX (<a href="http://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2018/matthew_shannon.html">proceeding</a>).</p>
